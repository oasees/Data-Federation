## 1.- Prerequisites

To properly install and use the API, the following prerequisites must be met.

1.1 Create a valid X.509 certificate for a designated domain 
--------------
The API requires installation on a machine equipped with DNS and a valid X.509 certificate. The first step is to determine the domain name assigned to the machine, after which a valid certificate must be generated for the specified domain.

A certificate from Let's Encrypt (Let's Encrypt) can be used; however, it will only be valid for the "development" branch of the "Gaia-X Lab" Gaia-X Clearing House (Gaia-X Clearing House). Consequently, the API will operate exclusively with development branch service URLs. The certificate should be placed in the "oasees.env" environment file, which will be further explained in later sections.

A certificate generated by Let's Encrypt (Let's Encrypt) can be used, but it will only be valid for the "development" branch of the "Gaia-X Lab" Gaia-X Clearing House (Gaia-X Clearing House). 
As a result, the API will exclusively utilize service URLs associated with the development branch.

It is necessary to have a valid certificate from the Trust Anchors (https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/policy-rules-committee/trust-framework/trust_anchors/), such as:

(Here, you can list the specific certificates required.)

A machine with external access, DNS, and a configured X.509 certificate is required. It is mandatory to install a web server such as Apache2 and ensure that the URL https://DOMAIN/.well-known/ is resolvable. The installation process and some configuration details will be covered in the next section, Installation. All JSON-LD self-descriptors that are created will be placed behind the previously mentioned URL.



1.- Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/mui/material-ui):

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

```
https://github.com/oasees/Data-Federation.git
cd Catalogue
```

2.- .env file

Modify this values:
````commandline
CONSUMER_URL=DNS or IP of consumer EDC connector (withoout http:// or https://)
PROVIDER_URL=DNS or IP of provider EDC connector (withoout http:// or https://)
PROVIDER_ASSIGNER=same value as edc.participant.id
````

3.-Install it and run:

```
docker compose up 

```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Choose one of the products you wish to consume and click "See More." The following window will appear:

If the data product has no contracts, the following window will be displayed:

And if it already has pre-established contracts, they will appear in the list. Whether there are contracts or not, a new one can always be created by clicking the "New agreement" button.

The following window will appear, and once the agreement is finalized, you must click the "Created" button, after which the created contract will appear in the contract list.

f you want to consume, you need to click the button below the "Transfer" column.

![Descripción](./images/front6.png)

The following window will appear with the corresponding steps of the transfer, after which we only need to copy the values of the public endpoint and the Authorization token. Use
curl or a program similar to Postman to complete the data consumption step.
